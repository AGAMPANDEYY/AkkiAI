2. Product Aware CTOs: This group (25%) is already familiar with technological solutions and is comparing options. They are primed for detailed product information and demonstrations.

3. Problem Aware CTOs: Representing 25% of the audience, these CTOs recognize their technological challenges but may not yet be aware of specific solutions. They present a significant opportunity for education and conversion.

4. Most Aware CTOs: While only 10% of the audience, these CTOs are closest to making a decision and require focused attention to differentiate our product from competitors.

5. Unaware CTOs: This group (10%) requires the most nurturing but can be valuable for long-term pipeline development.

<tg_to_drop>
No TG should be dropped entirely. While the Unaware group might seem less immediately profitable, they represent potential future customers and should be included in broader marketing efforts. However, they should receive the lowest priority in terms of resource allocation for lead generation.
